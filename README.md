# Makerlog v3 Public Roadmap

This is the public roadmap for the rebuild of Makerlog v3. Please view roadmap here: https://github.com/orgs/getmakerlog/projects/1

## Column Information

There are four columns to be aware of and they are as follows:

- `Exploring`: These are features that are being explored and potentially accepted.
- `Accepted`: These are features that have been accepted.
- `Rejected`: These are features that have been rejected currently, BUT could be explored in a future time.
- `Done`: These are things that have been completed.

**Please Note:** Existing features will be added to the board and have the label `existing` as to let everyone know that an existing Makerlog feature will persist over to the rebuild.

## Issues

All cards in the board will be converted to issues, where the community is welcome to talk about the feature in depth with everyone else to give feedback or guidance.

### Labels

Labels will give more metadata about what the task is about. As needed more labels will be created but for now, here's what existing labels mean:

- `existing`: This feature exists already on the current Makerlog.

## Discussions

Currently discussions have been enabled for this repository, so please feel free to utilize the sections: https://github.com/getmakerlog/roadmap/discussions

- `Q&A`: Any questions you may have about the new Makerlog and features.
